I am a university student currently studying Data Science. As I continue to learn programming, I am focused on developing strong analytical skills and building meaningful projects.

This Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project is my first step into the world of Data Science. Through this experience, I have gained insights into data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis, setting a foundation for more advanced projects in the future.

My goal is to keep improving and working on more complex data-driven projects as I advance in my learning journey.
