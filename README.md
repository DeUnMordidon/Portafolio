I am a university student currently studying Data Science. As I continue to learn programming, I am focused on developing strong analytical skills and building meaningful projects.

This project is my first real step into Data Science—an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on car prices. Through this, I’ve learned how to clean data, visualize trends, and extract valuable insights.

My goal is to keep improving and working on more complex data-driven projects as I advance in my learning journey.
