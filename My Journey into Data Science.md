I am a university student currently studying Data Science. As I continue to learn programming, I am focused on developing strong analytical skills and building meaningful projects.

Create EDA car prices
This project focuses on performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing detailed information about car prices. The dataset includes various attributes such as brand, model, year, transmission type, and mileage.

The primary goal of this analysis is to enhance my coding and analytical skills by working with real-world data.

Using Python, I implemented various techniques to clean, preprocess, and explore the dataset. I generated insightful visualizations to understand the impact of factors like brand reputation, mileage, and fuel type on car prices.

My goal is to keep improving and working on more complex data-driven projects as I advance in my learning journey
